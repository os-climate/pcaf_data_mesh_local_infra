Example : RUN pip install apache-airflow-providers-trino

## OpenmetaData integration configuration 
Airflow required to have authendication token from MetaData server to get auhtendicaed to send leanage data back to OpenMetaData. Currently this token by default generated from Open MetaData application. In order to get tocken, after run the "docker compose up", You need to login to OpenMeta applcation with the following credential 
url      -   localhost:8585
